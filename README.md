## 🧪 Testing the AI Story Weaver

The core functionality can be tested with sample inputs. Here are two examples:

**Product Name:** `Terracotta Sunbird Whistle`
**Artisan's Input:** `This is a traditional toy from my village in Bengal. We use local red clay and a special hand-pinching technique. It is fired in a wood-burning kiln. When you blow into it, it makes a beautiful, melodic whistle sound.`

**Product Name:** `Warli Art Handmade Journal`
**Artisan's Input:** `I paint the cover using the ancient Warli tribal art form. I use only a white natural pigment on handmade paper, depicting scenes of village life. Each design is drawn freehand from memory.`

The AI will generate multiple story options for each product.

## 📊 Pilot Results
