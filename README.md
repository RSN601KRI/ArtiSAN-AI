## 🧪 Testing the AI Story Weaver

The core functionality can be tested with sample inputs. Here is an example:

**Product Name:** `Terracotta Sunbird Whistle`
**Artisan's Input:** `This is a traditional toy from my village in Bengal. We use local red clay and a special hand-pinching technique. It is fired in a wood-burning kiln. When you blow into it, it makes a beautiful, melodic whistle sound.`

The AI will generate multiple story options for the product.
